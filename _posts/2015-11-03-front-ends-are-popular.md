As the developers we are, we often create semi-social profiles to accommodate our hobbies and,
enjoy a fertile ground for professional discussions.
More than often, people who recruit talents, can be found there as well.

As a front-end developer, my linkedIn profile gets more than a handful of job, which I politely decline,
along with people asking me as to whether I know anyone around my sphere.

Since FEDs are generally rare, and I honestly don't know any senior ones who are out there, looking,
add some spare time I had - this is now the official comment I'm replying with:

> In around 2008 , demand for front-end skills soared and the amount of FE talent leaving small companies in favor of large conglomerates rose to levels not seen since the C++ tide, in the start of the century. Most of the front-end developers were taken by large sums of money and over 80% of all the raw talent was recruited by entities, called 'startups'.

> This semi-legal trade was largely responsible for reducing the natural front-end developer pool from a few, unemployed hundreds, to current levels, where an unemployed front-end deveoper, is slightly more rare than a standard issue unicorn.

> In 2005, for example, an estimate of at least 20 developers were recruited per year, and up to 80% of the developers, were lost in the eternal fountain of steady, mildly-flavored 'job security' paradigm.

> The process of recruiting  was generally well-organized and difficult to control because of the availability of social networks, funds and the general developers desire to be called either a wizard, a guru or a ninja (often, a rockstar as well).

> These are dire times , my friend, dire times indeed. However, we must not loose hope and dwell upon the holy scripture, as quoted in Mathew 7:7;

> >"Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you".

> So knock, my friend, knock as hard as you can, until you either find someone, knock someone up or knock yourself out!

> Godspeed.
