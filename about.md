I am a front end web developer with a true passion for everything web! 

I believe that developers shouldn't be timid by technologies and should abstract their minds away from the actual implementation paradigms.

It means that you shouldn't limit yourself to specific technologies.
It also means that you shouldn't chase buzzwords.
